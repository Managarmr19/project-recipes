            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The term "bocapizza" refers to a popular Spanish dish that combines elements of a sandwich and a pizza. It consists of a baguette-style bread topped with tomato sauce, melted cheese, and various ingredients such as meats, vegetables, or condiments. After assembling, it's baked until the cheese is melted and the bread is crispy. This dish is often enjoyed as a quick meal, snack, or party food.</p>
